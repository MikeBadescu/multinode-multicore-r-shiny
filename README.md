# Multi-node Multi-core R / Shiny

This demo illustrates how to setup a Multi-node Multi-core R / Shiny server. It uses the ``parallel`` package in R to communicate with workers on other instances. A Shiny app is used to show how to integrate a parallel backend into Shiny.

## Remarks

Shiny server needs a good network connection. A clogged WiFi (high lag, many dropped packages) will make Shiny unresponsive.

## AWS AMI

For the Dallas RUG talk, I created two public AWS AMIâ€™s: 
- ami-c693afae / R-RStudio-Shiny
- ami-042e106c / R-RStudio-Shiny-DallasRUG_2015-04-11

If you intend to use them, please consider editing the ``authorized_keys`` files to remove the public keys which might allow unauthorized access.

I plan to update them soon after R 3.2.0 is being released.
